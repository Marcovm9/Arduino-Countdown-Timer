I connected a 7 Segment Display (common anode) to my Arduino UNO. I wrote a program that makes the display count down from 9 to 0 over a span of 15 seconds. 
This means the number displayed changes every 1.5 seconds. It's a fun project that adds a dynamic element to the display, creating a countdown effect.
